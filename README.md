# docker-bower
Docker container with bower installed and example compose file to use it automatedly.

Simply:
```
$ docker-compose run bower [command] [options]
```
or standalone
```
```
## How it works

## Why another bower container?
Because others are outdated, don't work as expected or are cumbersome to use. This image is as easy as using bower itself
